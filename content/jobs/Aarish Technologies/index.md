- I assisted in developing a Quantized Convolutional Neural Network, aiming to optimize storage utilization (space complexity) while automating various tasks involved in the process.
- I converted a Python PyTorch model of a Convolutional Neural Network to equivalent C code, with the objective of accelerating the computation and making it able to run on every hardware.
